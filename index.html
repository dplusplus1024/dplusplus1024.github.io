I’ve been working on a new electronic cash system
that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.
The paper is available at:
http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
The main properties:
Double-spending is prevented with a peer-to-peer
network.
No mint or other trusted parties.
Participants can be anonymous.
New coins are made from Hashcash style proof-ofwork.
The proof-of-work for new coin generation also
powers the network to prevent double-spending.
