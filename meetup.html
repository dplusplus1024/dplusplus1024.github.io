<b>Title:</b> Bitcoin2024, Bitcoin Park, and D++ Present: A Bitcoin Pizza Social
<br><br>
<b> Date:</b> 6:00 pm on Friday, January 26th
<br><br>
<b>Description:</b><br><br>
Join us for a special event where we'll share pizza, tour Bitcoin Park, and learn about bitcoin transactions with our special guest, bitcoin educator D++.
<br><br>
Together with the team from Bitcoin2024, she'll be asynchronously demoing transactions for anyone curious to learn how wallets work and get their hands on some satoshis. Don't be shy!
<br><br>
Be sure to arrive on time to grab some delicious pizza that Bitcoin2024 will be treating us to. See you there!
<br><br>
Please note: this is a bitcoin-only event. We kindly request that you refrain from discussing crypto-related topics such as altcoins, NFTs, trading, and blockchains.
