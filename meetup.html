<b> Date:</b> 6:00 pm on Friday, January 26th

<b>Description:</b><br><br>
Join us for a special social event where we'll share pizza, tour Bitcoin Park, and learn about bitcoin transactions.
<br><br>
Bitcoin educator D++ will be in town and joining us for this casual mixer. Along with the team from Bitcoin2024, she'll be asynchronously demoing transactions for anyone curious to learn how wallets work and get their hands on some satoshis. Don't be shy!

Be sure to arrive on time to grab some pizza that Bitcoin2024 is treating everyone to!

Please note: this is a bitcoin-only event. We kindly request that you refrain from discussing crypto-related topics such as altcoins, NFTs, trading, and blockchains.
